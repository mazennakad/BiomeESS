Biome Ecological strategy simulator (BiomeE) has been published in "Weng, E., Dybzinski, R., Farrior, C. E., and Pacala, S. W.: Competition alters predicted forest carbon cycle responses to nitrogen availability and elevated CO2: simulations using an explicitly competitive, game-theoretic vegetation demographic model, Biogeosciences, 16, 4577â€“4599, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4577-2019, 2019." as its supplementary material I.
In this model, vegetation is represented as plant functional types sampled from high dimensional spaces of combined plant traits that can consistently coexist in plant individuals. Individual plants are the basic unit to carry out physiological and demographic processes, e.g., photosynthesis, respiration, growth, reproduction, and mortality, and compete with each other. By this way, the model simulates competition for light and soil resources, community assembly and vegetation structural dynamics. Biogeochemical cycles are driven by the physiological and demographic activates of plants and microbes. The carbon and nitrogen in plant pools enter soil pools with plant mortality and turnover. The microbial decomposition processes drive soil carbon release and nitrogen mineralization.
